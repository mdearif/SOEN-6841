**Week 3**: *Feb 4 – Feb 10*  
**Date**: *Feb 9*

### Key Concepts Learned: 
*	Configuration Management – Configuration management is the process of systematically managing changes to the configuration of a system, product, or service throughout its lifecycle. Features of software products must be altered in response to requests from end users. Managing change requests and different versions of the software product is done in configuration management.
*	Benefits of Configuration Management – Organizes the actions required to keep the integrity of the product, creates order and lessens confusion, improves status accounting, improves adherence to standards, guarantees accurate product setups.
*	Characteristics of good Configuration Management system – The system should be auditable, centrally located, secure, accessible to all team members, accessible to remote team members. Also, version control and continuous integration should be followed.
*	Key Functions of Configuration Management – Configuration Identification (To define baseline components), Configuration Control (To provide a mechanism for preparing, evaluating, approving or disapproving all changes throughout the lifecycle), Configuration Status Accounting (To maintain a record of the evolution of the system), Configuration Auditing (To provide a mechanism to assess how closely the current system aligns with the system depicted in baseline and requirements documentation).
*	Smoke Testing – Smoke testing is a quick and basic test to check if critical functionalities of a software application are working correctly before more detailed testing is conducted. It helps identify major issues early in the development process. If the smoke tests fail, it suggests significant issues that need to be addressed before further testing can be conducted.
*	Auditing – Auditing entails assessing and analyzing the configuration items, procedures, and documentation to make sure they adhere to the rules, guidelines, and specifications. It confirms that the configuration management procedures are being successfully followed and finds any inconsistencies or problems that require attention.
*	Versioning – Versioning is the process of giving distinct numbers or identifiers to various iterations of configuration elements (such software code, documentation, or other artifacts) as they change over time. Versioning makes it possible to keep track of the modifications made to these materials, promotes cooperation, and guarantees that relevant versions are accessible to all parties when needed.
*	Project Planning – In project planning phase, elaborate planning for all project components is made. Whenever a software project is planned, the optimal trade-offs between potential benefits to the company, quality, schedule, and cost must be made. We create baseline structure here which is used to execute, monitor and control the project.
*	Software Project Planning Components – Resource Planning, Schedule Planning, Effort Planning, Cost Planning, Communication Planning, Configuration Management Planning, Tools Planning, Supplier Planning, Quality Planning, Scope Planning, Risk Planning
*	Top-Down Plan – In top-down project planning, we first assign time duration for the entire project. Later we assign time duration for smaller tasks within the time periods of their respective container bigger tasks.
*	Bottom-Up Plan – In bottom-up planning, time duration is assigned to small tasks first. Later, the time duration of all smaller tasks is added up to come up with time duration of their container larger task.
*	Work Breakdown structure (WBS) – A work breakdown structure, or WBS, is a methodical approach to divide the overall project work into smaller tasks. WBS also preserves the relationships between activities, making it possible to determine which tasks come first, which cannot begin before another work is finished, and so on.
*	Agile Model - The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It focuses on delivering working software in short iterations, typically lasting two to four weeks, called sprints.
*	Project Planning Techniques – 
  - i. Critical Path Method – The Critical Path Method (CPM), sometimes referred to as network analysis, finds the longest sequence of dependent jobs to determine the project timeline. Parallel jobs present different planning issues than linear initiatives. It becomes difficult to manage dependencies, start and finish times, and slack between jobs. By identifying the critical path, CPM facilitates efficient project planning and management, helping to overcome these issues.
  - ii. Goldratt’s Critical Chain Method – Tasks are buffered with some buffer to handle uncertainties and hazards. People who are given these responsibilities have a habit of putting them off until the very last minute. Therefore, even if a large buffer is given for their tasks, the project loses everything in the buffer. They put off doing their work until the very last minute, which usually leads to either shoddy work or duties that are completed later than expected.
